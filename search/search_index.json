RUSH microscopy Neurons and neural networks often extend hundreds of micrometers in three dimensions. Capturing the calcium transients associated with their activity requires volume imaging methods with subsecond temporal resolution. Such speed is a challenge for conventional two-photon laser-scanning microscopy, because it depends on serial focal scanning in 3D and indicators with limited brightness. Here we present an optical module that is easily integrated into standard two-photon laser-scanning microscopes to generate an axially elongated Bessel focus, which when scanned in 2D turns frame rate into volume rate. We demonstrated the power of this approach in enabling discoveries for neurobiology by imaging the calcium dynamics of volumes of neurons and synapses in fruit flies, zebrafish larvae, mice and ferrets in vivo. Calcium signals in objects as small as dendritic spines could be resolved at video rates, provided that the samples were sparsely labeled to limit overlap in their axially projected images. RUSHmini In order to reduce the cost of the cortex-wide brain imaging technique to make it accessible to researchers all over the world, we introduce RUSHmini, which aquires macro-resolution and sub-centimeter scale field of view. Consists of macro zoom microscope lens or evendigital camera lens, the cost of a RUSHmini system can be reduced to $30,000. We have demonstrate its capbilities of cortex-wide neural dynamic imaging at cellular resolution in mice. deepRUSH Interactions between the cerebral cortex and the deep cerebellar nuclei play important roles in cognitive processes. However, conventional microscopes fail to dynamically record cellular structures in distinct brain regions and at different depths, which requires high resolution, large field of view (FOV), and depth of field (DOF). Here we propose a single-photon excited fluorescence microscopy technique that performs simultaneous cortex and hippocampus imaging, enabled by a customized microscope and a chronic optical window. After we implant a glass microwindow above the hippocampus, the surface of the hippocampus is shifted to the superficial plane. We demonstrate that the proposed technique is able to image cellular structures and blood vessel dynamics in the cortex and the hippocampus in in vivo experiments, and is compatible with various mesoscopic systems. We have also inserted micro-prism to investigate neural activity in mPFC. | spectrumRUSH To reveal the causal relationship between neural activities and neural transmitters, we need to observe different types neural transmitters simutaneouly, which are labeled with different fluorescence proteins. We have built spectrumRUSH for this purpose. RUSH-MEA Electrods have their unique advantages of high temporal resolution and minimal damage to the brain tissue, but they failed to provide high spatial resolution. We combined RUSH microscopy and multi-electrode array (MEA) to achieve simutaneous observation in both superficial layer and deep nuclei. curveRUSH Conventional optical microscopy inmage one flat objective plane into a image plane. However, the skull of the mouse is close to a cylinder. To approximate its curvature, we adopt time division multiplexing techinique to achive fast aquisition on a cylinder, with a maximun frequency of 100 fps. RUSH-behavior acoustic-RUSH: This project aims at exploring the relationship between single neural signals in the desicion making process. visual-RUSH: This project aims to decode the neural signals under visual stimulations.
